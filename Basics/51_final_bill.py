"""
Write a Python program to calculate the final bill amount after applying
a discount. The program should take the total bill amount as input from
the user and apply the discount according to the following rules:

    Bill Amount        Discount
    Above 5000         20 percent
    3000 to 5000       10 percent
    Below 3000         No discount

    After calculating the discount, display the discount amount and the
    final bill amount payable by the customer.
"""

bill = float(input("Enter the total bill amount: "))

if bill > 5000:
    discount = bill * 20 / 100
elif bill >= 3000:
    discount = bill * 10 / 100
else:
    discount = 0

final_bill = bill - discount

print("Discount Amount =", discount)
print("Final Bill Amount =", final_bill)
